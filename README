You will need [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) version 1.5.8 or 1.6.0. Other versions will most likelly not work.

Some examples require [Go-SDL](github.com/banthar/Go-SDL) and some require [GLFW](github.com/jteeuwen/glfw).

To install type:

	git clone github.com/banthar/gl
	cd gl
	gomake
	sudo -E gomake install

Or, with goinstall:

    sudo -E  goinstall github.com/banthar/gl

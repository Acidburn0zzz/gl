This package works on Linux with go r60. You might be able to use it on Mac or even Windows, but it will require some effort.

You will need [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) version 1.5.8 or 1.6.0. Other versions will most likelly not work.

Some examples require [Go-SDL](github.com/banthar/Go-SDL) and some require [GLFW](github.com/jteeuwen/glfw).

You can install this package with goinstall.

    sudo -E  goinstall github.com/banthar/gl

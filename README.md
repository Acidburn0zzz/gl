This package works on Linux with go 1.0. You might be able to use it on Mac or even Windows, but it will require some effort.

You will need [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) at least version 1.5.8.

Some examples require [Go-SDL](github.com/banthar/Go-SDL) and some require [GLFW](github.com/go-gl/glfw).

You can install this package with go get.

    go get github.com/go-gl/gl
